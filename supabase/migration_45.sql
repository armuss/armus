-- Fixes a privilege-escalation hole in the teacher profile-change approval
-- flow. profiles.pending_changes is a jsonb blob a teacher writes to their
-- own row (dashboard.html only ever puts title/price/availability/bio in
-- it, but nothing stopped a direct API call from putting anything else in
-- there too). admin.html's approval handler spreads the whole object
-- (minus submitted_at) into the profile when an admin clicks "Approve"
-- (admin.html ~line 1644), while its review UI only ever renders the known
-- fields (renderPendingChangeBlock, ~line 1665) - so a smuggled
-- "is_admin": true or "status": "approved" stayed completely invisible to
-- the admin and was silently applied on approve.
--
-- Verified against a local Postgres instance: a non-admin could set
-- pending_changes to {"title": "...", "is_admin": true} on their own row,
-- and an admin's ordinary approve click on what looked like a harmless
-- title change flipped is_admin to true.
